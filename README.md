# T-Mobile Coding Challenge

### Task 4

```
Technical requirement: the server `stocks-api` should be used as a proxy
to make calls. Calls should be cached in memory to avoid querying for the
same data. If a query is not in cache we should call-through to the API.
```
--> Implemented api call using hapi server
--> used axios plugi for make https calls
--> catbox to cache api calls 
_**Implement the solution and make a PR from the branch `feat_proxy_server` to `master`**_

> It is important to get the implementation working before trying to organize and clean it up.
