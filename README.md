### Task 3

```
Business requirement: As a user I want to choose custom dates
so that I can view the trends within a specific period of time.
```

_**Implement this feature and make a PR from the branch `feat_custom_dates` to `master`.**_

> Use the material date-picker component

> We need two date-pickers: "from" and "to". The date-pickers should not allow selection of dates after the current day. "to" cannot be before "from" (selecting an invalid range should make both dates the same value)

--> Fetched stocks data based on the search criteria and displayed graph
